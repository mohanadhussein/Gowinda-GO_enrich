# Gowinda-GO_enrichment
## This repo will be replaced by GWAS_data_codes soon.
Codes and tuturial for running GOWINDA on a remote machine (ideally a more computationally advanced machine) are found in this repository. The objective of the analysis is to make sense of Genome Wide Association Studies results.
""The repo is currently being updated and organized, and will be available with the datasets and results soon""
